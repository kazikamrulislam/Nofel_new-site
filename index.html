                                Currently, the numbers of participants in clinical studies are low. 
                                Studies show that there is a myriad of reasons for these low numbers. 
                                But, some of the largest determining factors are the overwhelming amount 
                                of possible trials, the lack of ability to sort and find related trials, 
                                and the difficulty in making travel arrangements. An AI-based website could 
                                help potential participants sort through the thousands of studies to determine 
                                their best matches. This proposed website, AClinicalTrial.com, could also use 
                                its AI functionality to provide additional services such as travel planning 
                                and financial aid inquiries

                                    Clinical trials or interventional studies are experiments conducted in 
                                    clinical research. These trials study how human subjects react to certain 
                                    dical or behavioral interventions such as vaccines, drugs, and treatments. 
                                    They are also meant to test reactions to new ways of using already known 
                                    drugs and treatments. Their purpose is to determine if these interventions 
                                    are safe, efficacious, and effective. Clinical trials require approval from 
                                    their relevant countries prior to their start. This approval does not mean 
                                    that the intervention being tried is safe just that the clinical trial can 
                                    begin. In fact in the US, only approximately 10% of drugs which started in 
                                    clinical trials on humans are approved by the FDA. The process for developing 
                                    new drugs takes on average 10 years. The clinical trials alone last six to 
                                    seven years. This lengthy timeline is one reason why there is so much planning 
                                    put into conducting a clinical trial.

                                    Normally trials run in four phases. The first three are the most important 
                                    phases where the number of human participant goes from a small group to several 
                                    hundred or thousands. With many trials, in the early stage, a number of healthy 
                                    participants are needed to test if the medicine or the intervention can be 
                                    tolerated. In further stages, the clinical trials need patients who are affected 
                                    by the condition, which the intervention is designed to address. This is needed 
                                    because more precise measurements are required for the dosage and the timing. 
                                    There are many specific requirements based on the nature of the condition being 
                                    studied and the finding the right group of volunteers. It takes months or even 
                                    years to find suitable volunteers, this is especially true for trials which are 
                                    focused on rare diseases or those focused on children where a number of legal and 
                                    ethical questions arise regarding participation. The last phase is designed to 
                                    monitor the effect on the whole population and possible side-effects in widespread 
                                    usage. This phase happens when the intervention is already available in the marketplace.
