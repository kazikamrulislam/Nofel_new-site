                                    Currently, the numbers of participants in clinical studies are low. 
                                    Studies show that there is a myriad of reasons for these low numbers. 
                                    But, some of the largest determining factors are the overwhelming amount 
                                    of possible trials, the lack of ability to sort and find related trials, 
                                    and the difficulty in making travel arrangements. An AI-based website could 
                                    help potential participants sort through the thousands of studies to determine 
                                    their best matches. This proposed website, AClinicalTrial.com, could also use 
                                    its AI functionality to provide additional services such as travel planning 
                                    and financial aid inquiries

                                        Clinical trials or interventional studies are experiments conducted in 
                                        clinical research. These trials study how human subjects react to certain 
                                        dical or behavioral interventions such as vaccines, drugs, and treatments. 
                                        They are also meant to test reactions to new ways of using already known 
                                        drugs and treatments. Their purpose is to determine if these interventions 
                                        are safe, efficacious, and effective. Clinical trials require approval from 
                                        their relevant countries prior to their start. This approval does not mean 
                                        that the intervention being tried is safe just that the clinical trial can 
                                        begin. In fact in the US, only approximately 10% of drugs which started in 
                                        clinical trials on humans are approved by the FDA. The process for developing 
                                        new drugs takes on average 10 years. The clinical trials alone last six to 
                                        seven years. This lengthy timeline is one reason why there is so much planning 
                                        put into conducting a clinical trial.

                                        Normally trials run in four phases. The first three are the most important 
                                        phases where the number of human participant goes from a small group to several 
                                        hundred or thousands. With many trials, in the early stage, a number of healthy 
                                        participants are needed to test if the medicine or the intervention can be 
                                        tolerated. In further stages, the clinical trials need patients who are affected 
                                        by the condition, which the intervention is designed to address. This is needed 
                                        because more precise measurements are required for the dosage and the timing. 
                                        There are many specific requirements based on the nature of the condition being 
                                        studied and the finding the right group of volunteers. It takes months or even 
                                        years to find suitable volunteers, this is especially true for trials which are 
                                        focused on rare diseases or those focused on children where a number of legal and 
                                        ethical questions arise regarding participation. The last phase is designed to 
                                        monitor the effect on the whole population and possible side-effects in widespread 
                                        usage. This phase happens when the intervention is already available in the marketplace.

                                    ClinicalTrials.gov is the biggest registry and it lists 262,570 
                                    trials from all over the world. As of January 01, 2018, it includes 
                                    47% Non-US only trials, 36% U.S. only trials, 5% of the trials 
                                    which are conducted both in the US and Non-US, and 12% are trials 
                                    where the location is not provided. After the US as the number one 
                                    country with 107,579 total trials, Europe has around 70 thousand 
                                    trials, and China with around 27 thousand clinical trials. More 
                                    importantly, out of all of the trials, there are 45,551 studies 
                                    which are recruiting volunteers. They break down to 57% are outside 
                                    of the US (25,838), 38% are in the US (17,367) and 5% are both in 
                                    and out of the US (2,346).

                                    ClinicalTrials.gov started their registry in 2000 and had only around 
                                    5.5 thousand trials in the registry that year. But from 2006 and 2007, 
                                    there has been a steady sharp rise of registered trials, because of the 
                                    decision by International Committee of Medical Journal Editors to require 
                                    trial registration as a condition of publication from 2005, and the FDA 
                                    expanded registration requirements from the end of 2007.

                                    Both private and public sectors are involved in clinical trials. In the 
                                    US by law, trials can be funded by pharmaceutical companies, academic 
                                    medical centers, even voluntary groups, as well as Federal agencies such 
                                    as the National Institute of Health. The costs of running a trial and 
                                    developing a new medicine are huge and can be in the billions of dollars. 
                                    Reportedly 60% to 70% of the costs of development are for clinical trials. 
                                    This amounts to 80 to 90 billion dollars per year. In 2000, it was reported 
                                    that around 70% of the money from clinical drug trials in the US comes 
                                    from the pharmaceutical industry and not the public sector. In the EU, the 
                                    situation is similar where around 61% are sponsored by the pharmaceutical 
                                    industry and around 39% by non-commercial sponsors. Taking into account the 
                                    huge prices for developing and the small percent of these medications making 
                                    it to the market there has even been accusation that the private sector 
                                    tries influencing the results of the trials.

                                    But while it is true that pharmaceutical companies fund trials and they might 
                                    have their own interests at heart, the companies themselves are not the ones 
                                    who directly conduct that clinical trials. They are done and tested by 
                                    independent organizations according to protocols and designs which are 
                                    approved by the review boards. All the results are in the end reviewed by 
                                    the regulatory agencies, such as the FDA (US), EMA (Europe), and PMDA (Japan).

                                    In the last decade, a lot of those interested in conducting clinical trials 
                                    have started to outsource them to so-called Contract Research Organizations 
                                    (CROs). These basically privately-owned companies are specialized in research 
                                    and help with clinical trials, as well. They provide services for pharmaceutical 
                                    industries, as well as, governmental institutions. This outsourcing has been a 
                                    huge trend in the past years and many major corporations are using CROs. Around 
                                    50% of CROs perform outsourced clinical trial for the pharmaceutical industry. 
                                    Using CROs arguably cuts down the costs and time when specific trials are 
                                    conducted. It is reported that top areas of their research are oncology, 
                                    metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, and infectious disease. Some of the CROs 
                                    manage only a part of the trial, for example reviewing the clinical trial data 
                                    collected by a clinical investigator. Others are specialized in regulatory 
                                    support, data analysis, or clinical trial management. Bigger CROs offer to 
                                    manage all aspects of the trials. And while they perform the trial, the sponsor 
                                    is the one responsible for the integrity of the trial and the data behind it. 
                                    Cutting costs on the development of new medicine arguably allow pharmaceutical 
                                    companies not only to lower prices but also to develop drugs and treatments for 
                                    rare diseases which have a smaller market. There are over a thousand companies 
                                    in the world that are contract research organizations. Most of them are small 
                                    and have a revenue below ten million dollars, but there are large companies too. 
                                    The top 10 in 2016 controlled around 80% of the market. Not all of their revenue 
                                    comes from clinical trials, but the top 5 companies in this field in 2016 were:

                                    In the last few years, there has been a shift from conducting clinical 
                                    trials in developed countries toward those conducted in developing and 
                                    emerging nations. It is very common that clinical trials are conducted 
                                    in different countries at the same time. There are different reasons 
                                    for shifting to developing nations and while there are some practical 
                                    reasons, as for example to test a vaccine you need the population to be 
                                    in great number subjected to the disease at hand, there are financial 
                                    reasons as well. One NGO claims that currently one in every two drugs 
                                    sold in Switzerland has been at least partly developed on the basis of 
                                    clinical trials conducted in developing or emerging countries. The 
                                    reasons they mention for this change is that it’s not only cheaper, 
                                    but there are much fewer regulations, or at least they not as strict. 
                                    This fact might lead to a serious breach of ethical standards, however. 
                                    Almost half of these trials are never made public and therefore we have 
                                    no idea what kind of risk the volunteers have been subjected to. In 
                                    their conclusion, they claim that in the case of Switzerland, one of 
                                    the most developed nations of the world, it is impossible to determine 
                                    which clinical trials ultimately lead to the approval of specific drugs.

                                    A joint study by a number of organizations from December 2016 in Egypt 
                                    illustrates how clinical trials are run in developing countries. Egypt 
                                    has become a very attractive destination for clinical trials for a number 
                                    of reasons, leading it to host the most trials in the Middle East and 
                                    North Africa. The country itself has a good research infrastructure and 
                                    a fast-growing population, which has been described as “treatment-naïve”. 
                                    In other words, most of the population is not fully aware of the risks 
                                    from participating in these trials. The costs in Egypt are also lower 
                                    than other similar countries. In addition to this, almost 50% of the 
                                    population has no health insurance and the costs of treatment represent 
                                    a huge burden on the affected population. This leads to the problematic 
                                    situation in which poor people are joining clinical trials because this 
                                    is the only way for them to have access to medical treatment. Even if 
                                    the results of the trials are not certain and can be risky. This opens 
                                    the door for possible exploitation of these populations.

                                    Luckily, most of the trials are late-stage ones with products which have 
                                    already been available in developed countries. In fact, this is in 
                                    accordance with Egyptian laws which only allows testing products that 
                                    have already been approved in other countries. Still, around 16% of the 
                                    trials in Egypt are in phase 1 and 2. The problem in Egypt is that there 
                                    is no robust legislation governing trials and the governmental bodies 
                                    can interpret differently the conditions necessary for the trial to be 
                                    conducted. Furthermore, one of the biggest problems is that the drugs on 
                                    trial are not systematically available to most of the population. This 
                                    fact goes against certain ethical standards by not allowing participants 
                                    to more freely choose if they want to volunteer in the trial or not.

                                    The problems from the example of Egypt are present in many other cases, 
                                    as well. In 2013, a similar report was presented regarding phase 3 trials 
                                    in Argentina. Similar to the case of Egypt, a lack of clear legislation 
                                    rules led to certain companies taking advantage of enrolment of babies 
                                    in trials who are from very poor segments of the population. Another 
                                    problem is an improper use of placebo trials and most importantly the 
                                    discontinuation of treatment after the trial was over, not to mention 
                                    the lack of any compensation from problems arising from the trials.

                                    More reports show that there are no exceptions. One of them 
                                    reporting on Zimbabwe, stresses the same problem that 
                                    “limited access to health care and weaknesses in clinical 
                                    trial oversight in these countries leave room for possible 
                                    violation of the rights of vulnerable test subjects”. The 
                                    story is similar as with other cases involving a bad health 
                                    care system which is incapable of addressing major health 
                                    challenges, such as a very high morbidity and mortality rate, 
                                    high levels of almost 15% of adult population is infected 
                                    with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis is the second leading disease 
                                    in Zimbabwe and malaria. The high number of patients is very 
                                    suitable for clinical trials to be conducted especially in 
                                    later stages. Trend of moving trials toward the “less-developed” 
                                    world will only grow for a number of reasons. As previously said, 
                                    the number of volunteer and participants in developed countries 
                                    is not very high which makes trials hard to conduct and last 
                                    longer. While there are clear problems with consent in previously 
                                    reported cases of Egypt, Argentina, India, and Zimbabwe, it is 
                                    also clear that recruitment there is much easier and higher in 
                                    numbers. Sadly, the cost of the studies also dictates where they 
                                    will be conducted. Lower costs mean moving clinical trials into 
                                    those areas of the world. It should also be said that legislation 
                                    in most of these countries does indeed put high obligations 
                                    towards those conducting the trials, but the general lack of funds 
                                    put the regulatory commissions in a situation in which they cannot 
                                    properly do their work.

                                <h1>STORY OF KATHLEEN BARNARD</h1>
                                <div class="into_cont">
                                    Kathleen Barnard’s story is a powerful example of the potential 
                                    positive impact that a platform like A Clinical Trials could 
                                    have. In 2003, Ms. Barnard was told that the lump in her arm 
                                    was just fatty tissue. However, a second lump turned out to be 
                                    cancerous. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma. 
                                    Her instinct was to fight the cancer even though she was aware 
                                    of the fatal potential of her diagnosis. After six months of 
                                    standard treatment including chemotherapy, her cancer had 
                                    spread to her lung. At this point, her family pushed hard to 
                                    see if she could get access to experimental treatments. Cost of 
                                    these treatments was high, but she was able to participate in 
                                    a clinical trial. This treatment was able to eventually put her 
                                    cancer into a state of remission. The trial protocol did help her 
                                    for a time but in 2007 her cancer reemerged. In between her two 
                                    bouts with cancer, she had become an advocate for treatment options 
                                    for cancer patients. For her second cancer treatment, she once 
                                    again accessed newer treatment options. Her advocacy includes 
                                    dealing directly with the government and the pharmaceutical industry 
                                    to make treatment options available to cancer patients. She also 
                                    works to help cancer patients fundraise to cover the cost of their 
                                    treatment. Had Ms.

                                    Barnard had access to a platform such as A 
                                    Clinical Trials she would have potentially been able to locate 
                                    and access these experimental treatments quicker. The added elements 
                                    of assisting with travel set-up and the possibility of help with 
                                    costs are also aspects of the platform that could have greatly 
                                    assisted her and other cancer patients. Her cancer journey began 
                                    in 2003, but her advocacy work shows how many cancer patients still 
                                    need the help that she struggled to find. This help could potentially 
                                    exist in the A Clinical Trials platform.
