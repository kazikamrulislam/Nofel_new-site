                                Currently, the numbers of participants in clinical studies are low. 
                                Studies show that there is a myriad of reasons for these low numbers. 
                                But, some of the largest determining factors are the overwhelming amount 
                                of possible trials, the lack of ability to sort and find related trials, 
                                and the difficulty in making travel arrangements. An AI-based website could 
                                help potential participants sort through the thousands of studies to determine 
                                their best matches. This proposed website, AClinicalTrial.com, could also use 
                                its AI functionality to provide additional services such as travel planning 
                                and financial aid inquiries

                                    Clinical trials or interventional studies are experiments conducted in 
                                    clinical research. These trials study how human subjects react to certain 
                                    dical or behavioral interventions such as vaccines, drugs, and treatments. 
                                    They are also meant to test reactions to new ways of using already known 
                                    drugs and treatments. Their purpose is to determine if these interventions 
                                    are safe, efficacious, and effective. Clinical trials require approval from 
                                    their relevant countries prior to their start. This approval does not mean 
                                    that the intervention being tried is safe just that the clinical trial can 
                                    begin. In fact in the US, only approximately 10% of drugs which started in 
                                    clinical trials on humans are approved by the FDA. The process for developing 
                                    new drugs takes on average 10 years. The clinical trials alone last six to 
                                    seven years. This lengthy timeline is one reason why there is so much planning 
                                    put into conducting a clinical trial.

                                    Normally trials run in four phases. The first three are the most important 
                                    phases where the number of human participant goes from a small group to several 
                                    hundred or thousands. With many trials, in the early stage, a number of healthy 
                                    participants are needed to test if the medicine or the intervention can be 
                                    tolerated. In further stages, the clinical trials need patients who are affected 
                                    by the condition, which the intervention is designed to address. This is needed 
                                    because more precise measurements are required for the dosage and the timing. 
                                    There are many specific requirements based on the nature of the condition being 
                                    studied and the finding the right group of volunteers. It takes months or even 
                                    years to find suitable volunteers, this is especially true for trials which are 
                                    focused on rare diseases or those focused on children where a number of legal and 
                                    ethical questions arise regarding participation. The last phase is designed to 
                                    monitor the effect on the whole population and possible side-effects in widespread 
                                    usage. This phase happens when the intervention is already available in the marketplace.

                                        As previously noted, clinical trials depend on a large number of participants, 
                                        both those that are affected by the conditions, as well as, healthy participants. 
                                        Studies show that while people hold positive attitudes toward clinical trials 
                                        there is a low level of participation. For example, less than 5% of adults with 
                                        cancer participate in clinical trials related to the illness and only between 5 
                                        and 12% of healthy volunteers participate in trials. This is an ongoing issue 
                                        with clinical trials and is one of the reasons why the trials can take so long 
                                        to complete. The National Cancer Institute has determined that the two main reasons 
                                        why cancer patients do not want to participate are fear of getting a placebo and not 
                                        wanting to be used as “guinea pigs”.

                                        Given that clinical trials are a necessary step 
                                        for developing new and better treatments, participation levels need to increase. Of 
                                        course, trials must not override the rights and needs of patients, therefore it is of 
                                        utmost importance that any enrolment is done with as full consent as possible. Because 
                                        of possible infringement of patients’ rights, doctors are sometimes hesitant to talk to 
                                        patients about clinical trials. As well, they need to find a balance between giving too 
                                        little information, which can lead to confusion, and too much information, which can lead 
                                        to anxiety and perhaps despair. One proposed way on how to circumvent this problem is to 
                                        focus on motivating possible candidates to actively seek information about clinical trials 
                                        so that they are better prepared to discuss the information with their doctors and make an 
                                        informed decision.

                                        The access to information and motivation to actively seek out trials seems 
                                        to be critical. One study suggests “that patients who use the cognitively effortful information 
                                        seeking and information-processing decisional strategies are more effective in coping with 
                                        life-threatening illnesses.” Past research has shown that a lot of individuals who join 
                                        clinical trials do so not because of information about the study but because they are mostly 
                                        influenced by “non-rational” factors. These factors include the relationship with their doctor, 
                                        general beliefs about clinical trials, and even message cues. All this shows the importance of 
                                        introducing a simple and efficient way for interested parties to access clinical trial databases 
                                        and find the actual information they need.

                                        While there is no single unified worldwide register 
                                        of trials, ClinicalTrials.gov is the biggest database available with approximately two-hundred 
                                        and forty thousand registered trials. However, one study shows that it is far from easy to 
                                        conduct a proper search of this registry or others that are available. The study developed 
                                        four different search strategies — very precise, precise, sensitive, and very sensitive. 
                                        These strategies differ on the basis of how many specific conditions and how many specific 
                                        interventions were mentioned. The study determined that none of the strategies was very good, 
                                        but that the best results were with the sensitive one. Their conclusion was that the most 
                                        efficient search approaches, in terms of finding as many of the available relevant trials 
                                        and the fewest irrelevant trials, remains to be established.

                                        The people who are searching for clinical trials have different motives. A number of healthy 
                                        volunteers are needed, and while their motives might be purely altruistic, at least some see 
                                        it as a matter of gaining extra income. Indeed, in some trials, individuals are compensated 
                                        for the risk they take. One website claims that a volunteer can earn hundreds or even thousands 
                                        of dollars. But, those participants who are affected by the condition in question have many 
                                        more potential benefits. They will most likely be treated at leading medical facilities often 
                                        for free and will receive treatment which is not widely available. Moreover, they can take a 
                                        more active role in their own healthcare, help future generations, and all those suffering 
                                        from the same condition. Clinical trials are especially important for those suffering from 
                                        chronic, rare, and life-threatening medical conditions. It should also be noted that not 
                                        only do the patients receive medical treatment but in cases where the technology has not 
                                        yet found a cure, clinical trials are helpful as they can provide a better quality of life 
                                        for those who cannot be fully cured. Furthermore, without clinical trials developing vaccines 
                                        would be much more difficult. These vaccine studies, while controversial to a degree as they 
                                        are often conducted in underdeveloped countries which are the most affected ones and involve 
                                        a number of placebo methods as well, are the number one way of eradicating certain diseases.
